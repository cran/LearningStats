\format{
sicri2018 is a data frame with 7853 cases (rows) and 18 variables (columns) selected from the original and complete data base. The selection was done to have an overview of different types of random variables, as well as the topic interest for the students to discuss about.

In what follows the explanation and codification of the different variables is detailed. For every variable, we provide its name on the data base, the explanation of its content and all the possible categories, whether it makes sense, with their codes on the data base between brackets.

\description{
SICRI collects data on health-related behaviours, as long as they do not involve questions that can be considered sensitive or delicate, since with them simple self-declaration is not a way to obtain valid information. However, although the data collected will mainly refer to behaviours, data of another type may be collected for which simple self-declaration is an accommodated mode of measurement.
